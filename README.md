Chrometric
==========

This extension gathers metrics on ChromeOS devices and ships the data back to an ingestion endpoint.

For this extension to be useful, a LibreSpeed speedtest endpoint must be hosted on the infrastructure to be tested against. The [Go version of librespeedtest](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest-go) is perhaps the easiest way to stand this up, with other options being available on the [LibreSpeed repo](https://github.com/librespeed).

Configuration
---

To configure the extension, one must apply a policy for it within Google Admin. After adding Chrometric to the console, a policy similar the one below must be added under **Policy for extensions**.

Here is an example policy:

```json
{
  "dataLoggerConfig": {
    "Value": {
      "name": "humio",
      "token": "TOKEN_GOES_HERE"
    }
  },
  "speedtestUrls": {
    "Value": [
      {
        "name": "Librespeed Server",
        "server": "https://some.speedtestserver.here",
        "dlURL": "garbage.php",
        "ulURL": "empty.php",
        "pingURL": "empty.php",
        "getIpURL": "getIP.php"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Manual Chrome Web Store Deployment
---

Releases are provided on the Github releases page, however if a manual release is desired, the following directions will generate a release which can be manually uploaded to the [Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/devconsole).

In order to publish this extension to a private Chrome Web Store, a zip file will need to be created. Use the following process to do so:

```bash
zip -r ../chrometric-x.x.x.zip ./* -x ".git*"
```

Be sure to change `x.x.x` to the actual version being zipped, which can be found in `manifest.json`

ToDo
---

* Add directions for customizing the bundle with a data logger before creating the zip

Thanks

Many thanks to the [LibreSpeed Project](https://github.com/librespeed), without which this idea would not have worked as well as it has. Also thanks to [Mark Gewurz](https://github.com/markgewurz) for the inspiration and [Graham Gilbert](https://github.com/grahamgilbert) for his work on [chromesal](https://github.com/salopensource/chromesal), which was very instructive on using ChromeOS APIs.
